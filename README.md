# COVID19 Project
Welcome to my first ever SQL + Tableau project.

[Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tanishka.patil/viz/COVIDGlobalDashboard_16796892491390/Dashboard1)

**Project Description**<br>
This project analyzes the global COVID19 data. 

**Exploratory Analysis Using SQL**<br>
First, I played around with the data and compared the total cases, total deaths with different countries' population to find the countries with highest infection rate and highest death count. 
After that I moved on to looking at the global numbers and looking at continent-wise data. I then joined two tables of CovidDeaths and CovidVaccination to explore percetnage of people vaccinated globally.

**Data Visualization in Tableau**<br>
As it is my first project, I decided to keep things simple for Tableau visualizations. I mainly tried to visualize the following data:
1. Continent-wise Death Count
2. Countries with high-infeciton rates
3. Time series of COVID infected population

**Repository Contents**
1. COVIDData.sql - Captures the SQL queries I ran for analysis
2. TableauVizQueries.sql - Contains the 4 major SQL queries I ran for data visualization in Tableau
